# Secure File Deleter

Secure File Deleter is an application designed to securely delete files and folders from your computer. It uses data overwrite methods before deletion to prevent file recovery.

## Features

- Secure file deletion with data overwrite.
- Drag-and-drop support for easy file and folder selection.
- Simple interface for selecting files and folders to delete.
- Option to cancel selection.

## Security

Your data security is crucial, and regular file deletion methods (like moving to the recycle bin) donâ€™t ensure that your data is gone for good. Secure File Deleter uses advanced techniques to guarantee **complete and irreversible deletion** of your files.

### 1. **Data Overwriting**

Instead of just deleting files, Secure File Deleter overwrites the data multiple times with random information, making recovery impossible. 

- **Overwrite cycles**: 7 overwrite passes ensure that files are effectively destroyed.
- **Block size**: Data is overwritten in small blocks to fully erase all traces of the file.

### 2. **File Renaming Before Deletion**

To further protect your data, files are renamed to a random string before deletion. This prevents file recovery tools from locating and restoring the deleted files by name.

- **Random filenames**: Each file is renamed to a 16-character random string, making recovery extremely difficult.

### 3. **Folder Deletion**

The app recursively deletes all files and subfolders within a folder, ensuring complete destruction of data before the folder is removed.

### 4. **Using Standard Security Practices**

Secure File Deleter relies on trusted, system-level tools to interact with files, ensuring reliable and error-free deletion. This minimizes risks and enhances the security of your data destruction process.

### Why It Matters

Deleted files can still be recovered, especially on SSDs, using basic recovery tools. Secure File Deleter ensures that once a file is deleted, it is **gone for good**. This is essential when dealing with sensitive or confidential data, giving you peace of mind knowing your files are securely erased.
